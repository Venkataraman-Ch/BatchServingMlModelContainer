# BatchServingMlModelContainer
A docker container to perform batch serving of a ML mode
# train.py uses 3 different models (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Neural Network (NN), Decision Tree Classifier (DT)) to train the model for training data ('train.csv')
# all 3 model files created under modelfiles folder.
# Which will be used by test data ('test.csv') in inference.py
# Docker image will be created using Dockerfile with required requirements as per 'requirements.txt'

# To test it, Pull from repository and test it.
# Happy coding and learning :)
